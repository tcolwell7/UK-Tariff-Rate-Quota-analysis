### Comparative analysis and visualisations of UK Tariff Rate Quotas following the first full year of EU-exit using R. 

### Description

Initial analysis following publication of two public UK TRQ data sources compared against public EU quota data comparing TRQ fill rates to the year leading up to EU-exit.

The data is to be broken down into groupings, defined by stakeholder interest. Any output is presented across each region. A secondary purpose of this work is to automate repetitive processes to improve efficiency working across a multi-disciplinary team. 

User centred functions have been created for the purpose of analytical outputs to be presented to non-analysts using MS applications. They are designed so users can tailer their charts depnding on what story the data is highlgihting.
